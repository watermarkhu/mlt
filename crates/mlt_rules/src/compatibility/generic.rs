//! Generic (AST-pattern) compatibility checks.
//!
//! These checks cannot be matched by the function-name lookup table (their
//! data-file entries have empty `function_name`), so each is implemented as a
//! pattern check over the tree-sitter AST. The checks are grouped by pattern
//! family; each group lives in its own `check_*.rs` module and exposes a
//! `pub(crate) fn collect_checks(engine, node, source, diagnostics)`.
//!
//! `collect_node_checks` (below) is the single dispatch point called from the
//! engine's file-level walker.
