description: Orchestrates implementation of MATLAB Code Analyzer rules in mlt: plan in the main session, then review and implement via parallel Reviewer → Implementer subagent flows. Use when implementing one or more new lint rules or checks in this repo, or when asked to run the rule pipeline / per-rule flow. Launches many independent flows in parallel, one per rule.

# Rule Implementation Pipeline (plan in main → Review → Implement)

Every new MATLAB Code Analyzer rule in `mlt` is implemented as follows:

1. **Planning happens in the MAIN session** (not a subagent) — the main session owns
   the single Playwright MCP instance and does the rule-context lookup and codebase
   study, then writes the implementation plan.
2. **Review** — one `reviewer` subagent per rule, launched in parallel.
3. **Implement** — one `implementer` subagent per rule, launched in parallel.

Flows for different rules are fully independent and run in **parallel** for steps 2
and 3.

## The agents

| Step | Where | Subagent (`subagent_type`) | Model | Output |
|------|-------|---------------------------|-------|--------|
| 1. Plan | main session | — | `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash` (current) | Implementation plan |
| 2. Review | subagent | `reviewer` | `opencode-go/mimo-v2.5` | Verdict + corrected plan |
| 3. Implement | subagent | `implementer` | `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash` | Code, tests, docs + verification |

Agents are defined in `.opencode/agent/{reviewer,implementer}.md`.

## Rule context lookup (main session only)

Before planning, the rule's official context (description, severity, examples) MUST be
looked up at:
`https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/index-of-code-analyzer-checks.html`
using Playwright (`playwright_browser_navigate` → `playwright_browser_find` →
`playwright_browser_snapshot`). MathWorks returns HTTP 403 to plain `webfetch`, so
Playwright is required. Fallback archive:
`~/.local/share/opencode/tool-output/tool_fe291ac62001Qy9pI2rEjqHVAK`.

**IMPORTANT:** there is a single Playwright MCP instance. Only the main session may
drive it. Subagents must never call Playwright tools — they must not contend for or
mutate browser state. Rule context is passed to them as plan text in the prompt.

## Orchestration

Given a list of rule IDs (e.g. the remaining readability checks COMNL, STLOW, FLUDLR,
MFAMB, FVINR), run one flow per rule:

1. **Plan in the main session.** For each rule:
   - Look up the rule context on the MathWorks check index via Playwright (see above).
   - Study the codebase conventions: `AGENTS.md` "Adding a New Rule", the target
     module in `crates/mlt_rules/src/`, a reference rule like `nosemi.rs`, and
     `docs/nosemi.md`.
   - Write a self-contained implementation plan including: rule ID, official
     description, severity, category, can_be_disabled; `target_node_types()` or
     file-level `check_file`; concrete detection logic with the tree-sitter node
     kinds involved and how to distinguish the pattern from lookalikes (remember
     `function_call` is also used for indexing); MATLAB examples that MUST fire and
     MUST NOT fire; exact files to create/modify (rule module, `lib.rs` `pub mod`,
     `docs/<id>.md`, `docs/rules.md` row, `zensical.toml` nav); any rule-specific
     config params; tests to add; pitfalls.
2. **Launch ALL Reviewers in parallel** — one `task` call per plan, all in a single
   message, `subagent_type: "reviewer"`, prompt includes the rule ID, the category,
   and the plan text. Do not wait between them.
3. **Collect the verdicts**, then **launch ALL Implementers in parallel** — one per
   approved/corrected plan, `subagent_type: "implementer"`, prompt includes the rule
   ID, the category, and the plan text. Skip a rule only if the Reviewer rejects it
   outright with no usable plan; otherwise pass the corrected plan through.

Do not serialize steps 2 and 3. Each is a batch of parallel tasks.

## Completion criteria per rule

- `cargo build` succeeds
- `cargo clippy --all-targets` passes with zero warnings
- `cargo test` passes (fires, not-fires, and config tests from the plan)
- Docs updated: `docs/<rule_id>.md`, `docs/rules.md`, `zensical.toml`
- `crates/mlt_rules/src/lib.rs` has the `pub mod` line for any new module

## Notes

- Do not commit changes unless the user explicitly asks.
- If the tree-sitter grammar cannot represent the pattern (e.g. `function_call` also
  covers indexing), the plan/review must address the ambiguity explicitly.
