# Good Practices

**Default severity:** Warning
**Auto-fix:** Yes
**Category:** Good Practices
**Can be disabled:** Yes

## What this rule does

Encourages recommended coding practices for MATLAB code. All 106 checks are
handled by a single hybrid engine (`GoodPracticesEngine`). Node-level checks
cover simple pattern matches (error handling, `eval` usage, string
comparisons, parfor/spmd usage, redundant comparisons), while file-level
checks use metadata extraction and the symbol table for context-aware
analysis (last-statement detection, variable shadowing, class and property
validation). Each diagnostic carries the specific check ID (e.g. `TRYNC`,
`EVLCS`, `PFRNI`).

The checks span error handling, string and comparison idioms, `eval`/dynamic
code, parfor/spmd parallel practices, structure and field access, OOP and
class properties, logical-usage patterns, shared variables, arity, and App
Designer methods.

## Check IDs

### TRYNC

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

TRY statement should have a CATCH statement to check for unexpected errors.

### CTCH

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Best practice is for CATCH to be followed by an identifier that gets the error information.

### WLAST

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

WARNING('') does not reset the warning state. Use LASTWARN('') instead.

### WNTAG

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

The first argument of WARNING should be a message identifier. Using a message identifier allows users better control over the message.

### ERTAG

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

The first argument of ERROR should be a message identifier.

### MEXCEP

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

To report an MException as a warning, use a format specifier to ensure the message is printed correctly. For example, 'warning(E.identifier, "%s", E.message)'.

### STCMP

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Use STRCMP instead of == or ~= to compare character vectors, or convert character vectors to string scalars for direct comparison.

### STCI

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Use STRCMPI(str1,str2) instead of using UPPER/LOWER in a call to STRCMP.

### STISA

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Consider using ISA instead of comparing the class name.

### STRNU

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

This variable, apparently a structure, is changed but the value might be unused.

### EVLCS

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

'eval' is inefficient and makes code less clear. Call the statement directly.

### EVLDOT

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

'eval' is inefficient and makes code less clear. Use dynamic field names to access structure fields or object properties instead.

### EVLEQ

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

'eval' is inefficient and makes code less clear. Assign to the variable directly.

### EVLSYS

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

'eval' is inefficient and makes code less clear. To make calls to the operating system use the system function instead.

### EVLDUAL

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

This use of 'eval' is unnecessary and can be removed. Call the evaluated function directly using parentheses. For example, use 'load(filename)' instead of 'eval(['load ' filename])'.

### EVLSEQVAR

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Using 'eval' to dynamically assign variables is not recommended.

### NOANS

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Using ANS as a variable is not recommended as ANS is frequently overwritten by MATLAB.

### LOAD

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

To avoid conflicts with functions on the path, specify variables to load from file.

### SEPEX

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **no**

Consider using newline, semicolon, or comma before this statement for readability.

### NBRAK1

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **yes**

If you intend to specify expression precedence, use parentheses () instead of brackets [].

### LNGNM

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Names longer than VAR_NUMBER characters are not supported. This name has been truncated to VAR_NUMBER characters.

### CHAIN

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **no**

Expressions like a VAR_NAME b VAR_NAME c are interpreted as (a VAR_NAME b) VAR_NAME c. Typically, to test a VAR_NAME b VAR_NAME c mathematically, if all arguments are numeric scalars, use (a VAR_NAME b) && (b VAR_NAME c), otherwise use (a VAR_NAME b) & (b VAR_NAME c).

### DISPLAY

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Overloading DISPLAY is not recommended.

### FNDEF

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Function name VAR_NAME is known to MATLAB by its file name: VAR_FILE.

### NOIN

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **no**

Method VAR_NAME should either be a static method or have at least one input argument.

### VALST

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **no**

VAR_NAME must be the last argument in the argument list.

### PROP

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **no**

VAR_NAME is also the name of a property, which may be confusing. Use obj.PropertyName syntax to reference the property, or rename this variable to improve readability.

### CPROP

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **no**

VAR_NAME is also the name of a property, which may be confusing. Use obj.PropertyName syntax to reference the property, or rename the property to improve readability.

### FVAL

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Calling functions using 'feval' is usually not necessary. Call the function directly instead.

### FNCOLND

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Consider explicitly defining the array, and then using the END operator to index into it.

### COMNC

Severity: **info** · Auto-fix: **yes**

Comment with percent (%) following comma acts as a row separator. Replace the comma with a semicolon to make the row separation clearer. Alternatively, replace the percent (%) with an ellipsis (...) to add a comment inside a row.

### ITERS

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

The Code Analyzer type analysis may be incorrect here.

### LOGPROD

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Using 'prod' on a logical expression is hard to understand and might be incorrect. Consider using 'all' instead.

### LOGMIN

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Using 'min' on a logical expression is hard to understand and might be incorrect. Consider using 'all' instead.

### LOGMAX

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Using 'max' on a logical expression is hard to understand and might be incorrect. Consider using 'any' instead.

### ELARLOG

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

The VAR_NAME operator in the expression VAR_NAME(A VAR_NAME B) is unexpected. Should this be VAR_NAME(A) VAR_NAME B?

### SHOCIRAA

### MCHDT

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Declaring the value of a property as a handle might cause all instances to share the same default handle. To avoid sharing, create the handle for this property in the constructor. To express that sharing is intentional, use the Constant property attribute.

### SHVAU

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Confusing usage of name VAR_NAME on lines VAR_NUMBER and VAR_NUMBER. Initialize VAR_NAME before line VAR_NUMBER to make it a shared variable or rename VAR_NAME on line VAR_NUMBER to disambiguate.

### MCVM

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Value class method that modifies the object must return the modified object.

### MCCSPS

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

Constant property VAR_NAME is not modified. 'VAR_NAME.VAR_NAME' creates a struct named VAR_NAME with a field named VAR_NAME.

### MCSUP

Severity: **warning** · Auto-fix: **no**

The set method for the property VAR_NAME should not access another property (VAR_NAME).

## Automatic fixes

Rewrites the flagged construct into the cleaner equivalent:

- `call(...) == true` → `call(...)` (COMPNOP) and
  `call(...) ~= true` / `call(...) == false` → `~call(...)` (COMPNOT).
- `parfor i = 1:step:end` → `parfor i = 1:end` (PFRNI).
- `%comment` → `% comment` (COMNC).
- `(scalar)` → `scalar` (NBRAK1).

## Examples

### Incorrect

```matlab
if isa(x, 'double') == true      % COMPNOP
    disp('double');
end
parfor i = 1:2:10                % PFRNI
    y(i) = i;
end
%comment with no space           % COMNC
x = (5);                         % NBRAK1
```

### Correct

```matlab
if isa(x, 'double')              % COMPNOP fix applied
    disp('double');
end
parfor i = 1:10                  % PFRNI fix applied
    y(i) = i;
end
% comment with space             % COMNC fix applied
x = 5;                           % NBRAK1 fix applied
```

### Fixed

```diff
- if isa(x, 'double') == true
+ if isa(x, 'double')
- parfor i = 1:2:10
+ parfor i = 1:10
```
