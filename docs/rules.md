## Data-Driven Check IDs

These tables are generated from the TOML data files by the TypeScript
generator in `docs/scripts/gen_rules_docs.ts`. Rebuild the docs (`bun run docs:gen`)
to refresh them whenever `data/compatibility.toml` or
`data/suggested_improvements.toml` changes.

### Behavior Changes (905 checks)

| Check ID | Message |
| -------- | ------- |
| [`SHVAI`](rules/compatibility.md#shvai) | Explicitly define shared variables in the parent function before calling the nested function. MATLAB does not share uninitialized variables between a nested function and the parent function. |
| [`LENEMP`](rules/compatibility.md#lenemp) | Passing in text with no characters will omit the object from appearing in the legend. To revert to the old behavior, use a whitespace character instead of text with no characters. |
| [`INTRPC`](rules/compatibility.md#intrpc) | 'interp1(...,'cubic')' changed in R2020b to perform cubic convolution. To continue using shape-preserving piecewise cubic interpolation, use 'interp1(...,'pchip')' instead. |
| [`IDISVARHIGH`](rules/compatibility.md#idisvarhigh) | Variable must be explicitly defined before first use. In some cases, the definition was not required in previous releases, but it is now required. |
| [`LEGPVPAIR`](rules/compatibility.md#legpvpair) | 'legend' has changed and might interpret the name of an argument as a legend property instead of a label. To include a label with the same name as a legend property, specify the labels using a cell array or string array. Refer to the documentation for a list of affected property names. |
| [`CLBGEN`](rules/compatibility.md#clbgen) | Starting in R2020a, interfaces created by 'clibgen.generateLibraryDefinition' return clib.array object instead of the equivalent MATLAB array for primitive types. Notify your users to update their code to use clib arrays. To revert to the old behavior, call 'clibgen.generateLibraryDefinition' with the 'ReturnCArrays' argument set to false. |
| [`CLBBLD`](rules/compatibility.md#clbbld) | Starting in R2020a, interfaces created by 'clibgen.buildInterface' return clib.array object instead of the equivalent MATLAB array for primitive types. Notify your users to update their code to use clib arrays. To revert to the old behavior, call 'clibgen.buildInterface' with the 'ReturnCArrays' argument set to false. |
| [`COLMP`](rules/compatibility.md#colmp) | In R2019a and previous releases, the default colormap size is 64. Starting in R2019b, colormaps have 256 colors by default. If your code depends on a colormap having 64 colors, specify the number of colors when querying the colormap. For example, parula(64) queries the 64-color parula colormap. |
| [`FDTAG`](rules/compatibility.md#fdtag) | 'findall' with 'Exploration.Pan', 'Exploration.ZoomIn', 'Exploration.ZoomOut', 'Exploration.DataCursor', 'Exploration.Brushing', or 'Exploration.Rotate' might return empty because the data exploration buttons have moved from the figure toolbar to the axes toolbar. To customize the axes interactions, use the 'axtoolbar' and 'axtoolbarbtn' functions. |
| [`NSTIMP`](rules/compatibility.md#nstimp) | Nested functions now inherit import statements from this parent function. If the nested functions intend to call functions on the path, ensure that the imported namespaces do not contain functions with the same name. |
| [`IDISVARLOW`](rules/compatibility.md#idisvarlow) | To avoid a potential conflict with functions on the path, explicitly define the variable before indexing into it. |
| [`WEBBEHAVE`](rules/compatibility.md#webbehave) | The 'web' function now opens external sites in your system browser by default. In a future release, 'web' will open all pages using the system browser. Consider specifying the '-browser' option to open all pages in your system browser. |
| [`GLGRI`](rules/compatibility.md#glgri) | Starting R2021a, the second output of 'geoloc2grid' is a geographic raster reference object instead of a referencing vector. Most Mapping Toolbox functions that accept referencing vectors as input also accept geographic raster reference objects, so existing code is unlikely to be affected. |
| [`V2MTX`](rules/compatibility.md#v2mtx) | Starting R2021a, the second output of 'vec2mtx' is a geographic raster reference object instead of a referencing vector. '[Z,R] = vec2mtx(LAT,LON,Z1,R1,...)' is an exception, where R1 is a referencing vector or matrix. Most Mapping Toolbox functions that accept referencing vectors as input also accept geographic raster reference objects, so existing code is unlikely to be affected. |
| [`PTCLO`](rules/compatibility.md#ptclo) | Changing the axes LineStyleOrder or ColorOrder properties of an existing chart now affects the chart immediately. To revert to the old behavior, set either the axes LineStyleOrderIndex or ColorOrderIndex to any value (such as its current value) before changing LineStyleOrder or ColorOrder. |
| [`PTDLO`](rules/compatibility.md#ptdlo) | Specifying multiple line styles in the axes LineStyleOrder might result in charts that render differently than in the previous releases. MATLAB uses a new indexing scheme to select colors and line styles. To revert to the old behavior, set either the axes LineStyleOrderIndex or ColorOrderIndex to any value (such as its current value) and call 'hold on' before creating your chart. |

## Rule Categories

mlt organizes rules into the same categories as MATLAB's Code Analyzer:

| Category | Config Key | Description |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Incomplete Analysis | `incomplete-analysis` | Internal linter limits and analysis failures |
| Syntax Errors | `syntax-errors` | Parser-level syntax validation |
| Language Specification | `language-specification` | Language constraint violations |
| Bugs | `bugs` | Likely bugs and logic errors |
| Custom Checks | `custom-checks` | Configurable code complexity/style metrics |
| Naming | `naming` | Naming convention enforcement |
| Compatibility | `compatibility` | Deprecated/removed functions and APIs |
| Forward Compatibility | `forward-compatibility` | Forward compatibility issues |
| Good Practices | `good-practices` | Common best practices |
| Unset Variables | `unset-variables` | Variables that may not be defined before use |
| Unused Constructions | `unused-constructions` | Dead code and unused constructions |
| Suggested Improvements | `suggested-improvements` | Suggestions for improved code patterns |
| Readability | `readability` | Readability improvements |
| Formatting | `formatting` | Code formatting suggestions |
| Performance | `performance` | Performance improvement suggestions |
| Code Generation | `code-generation` | MATLAB Coder constraints |
| Fixed-Point | `fixed-point` | Fixed-point toolbox specific |
| Deployment | `deployment` | MATLAB Compiler deployment constraints |
| System Objects | `system-objects` | System object validation |
| Unsupported | `unsupported` | Unsupported features |
| Behavior Changes | `behavior-changes` | Behavior changes between MATLAB versions |
| Configuration Issues | `configuration-issues` | Configuration file validation |

## Severity Levels

Rules are categorized into three severity levels:

### Error

Critical issues that likely indicate bugs or broken code:

- Code that will fail at runtime
- Language specification violations
- Syntax errors

### Warning

Issues that affect code quality:

- Common bug patterns
- Good practice violations
- Deprecated function usage

### Info

Low-priority suggestions:

- Formatting preferences
- Performance improvement hints
- Readability suggestions

### Configuring Severity

Override default severities in `.mlt.toml`:

```toml
[lint.rules]
NOSEMI = "error"    # Upgrade from info to error
```

Or in a full table:

```toml
[lint.rules.NOSEMI]
severity = "error"
ignore_functions = ["disp", "fprintf"]
```

### Category-Level Configuration

Enable, disable, or override severity for entire categories:

```toml
[lint.categories]
performance = "off"           # Disable all performance rules
compatibility = "warn"        # Override all compatibility rules to warning
formatting = "info"           # Set all formatting rules to info
```

Per-rule configuration always takes precedence over category-level settings.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for full details.

## Enabling and Disabling Rules

All rules are enabled by default. Disable individual rules:

```toml
[lint.rules]
NOSEMI = "off"
```

Or disable entire categories:

```toml
[lint.categories]
behavior-changes = "off"
```

## Auto-fix Support

Rules marked with "Yes" in the Auto-fix column provide automatic fixes. Run mlt with `--fix` to apply them:

```bash
mlt --fix src/**/*.m
```

Fixes are applied atomically per file. Overlapping fixes are detected and the conflicting fix is skipped with a warning.

## Adding New Rules

mlt uses auto-registration via the `inventory` crate. To add a new rule:

1. Create a new module in `crates/mlt_rules/src/` (e.g., `agrow.rs`)
2. Implement the `Rule` trait with a `from_config` factory
3. Add `inventory::submit!(crate::RuleRegistration::new("AGROW", Agrow::from_config));` at the bottom
4. Add documentation in `docs/rules/agrow.md`

No manual edits to `lib.rs` are needed beyond adding the `pub mod` declaration.

See the [repository](https://github.com/watermarkhu/mlt) for the full development guide.
