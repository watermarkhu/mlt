## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from source
cargo install --path crates/mlt_cli

# Lint MATLAB files
mlt path/to/file.m

# Auto-fix issues
mlt --fix path/to/file.m
```

## Example Output

```text
src/compute.m:2:5 [W] M001: Statement without trailing semicolon may produce unintended console output
src/compute.m:4:5 [W] M001: Statement without trailing semicolon may produce unintended console output

Found 2 issues in 1 file.
```

## Design Principles

- **Single-pass traversal** — The AST is walked exactly once. Rules subscribe to node types and are dispatched via an O(1) registry lookup.
- **tree-sitter powered** — Leverages `tree-sitter-matlab` for fast, incremental, error-tolerant parsing.
- **Workspace architecture** — Separated into `mlt_core` (engine), `mlt_rules` (rule implementations), and `mlt_cli` (interface).
- **Inspired by the best** — Architecture modeled after [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [rumdl](https://github.com/rvben/rumdl).
